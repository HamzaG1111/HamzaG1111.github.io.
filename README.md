# HamzaG1111.github.io.
1. Hamza Gulbahari, mhgulbahari@my.waketech.edu
2. My Github account is pretty new so I dont have much in it.
3. The repository that I just made was an easy task but the guidance wasn't for me.
4. I have had some trouble while making the clone like haveing teo github accounts which I was login with one on the website and with the other one on the app I had to fix that. The '.' at the end of the #HamzaG1111.github.io. was not compromise with the app so I removed the . and it worked.
